Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Content
-------

The course covers two topic areas:

*   Investigation and remediation of contaminated sites
*   Design and construction of waste-disposal sites

The course emphasizes the practical engineering aspects of these topics, but also covers theoretical aspects of mass transport in the subsurface and how it is important to these topics.

You can complete an optional paper to substitute for one exam grade but you must take all exams.

Regular attendance and class participation will be considered in assigning final grades.

Collaboration on homework is permitted â€” please list your collaborators.

Reading
-------

Please complete the reading before each lecture. Some parts of the reading are labeled "skim" in the syllabus below. My goal for you is to be familiar with these documents and their general contents.

You are requested to read a book for the final lecture: Harr, Jonathan. _A Civil Action._ New York: Random House, 1995.

If you have not taken course 1.72, Ground Water Hydrology, you should review basic principles of the subject. Please see me for suggested reading.
